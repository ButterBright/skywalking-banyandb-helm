BanyanDB, as an observability database, aims to ingest, analyze and store Metrics, Tracing, and Logging data.
It's designed to handle observability data generated by observability platforms and APM systems, like [Apache SkyWalking](https://github.com/apache/skywalking) etc.

BanyanDB Helm Chart repository provides ways to install and configure SkyWalking in a BanyanDB cluster. The scripts are written in Helm 3.
